 * It is a multi-line string literals which prevents the need for most escape sequences,
 * formats the string automatically, and allows the developer and gives control to format

 * Two new escape sequences are newlines (line-terminator) denoted by \ and
 * second is for white space (single space) denoted by \s.
 * Now this has become as standard feature from preview.
